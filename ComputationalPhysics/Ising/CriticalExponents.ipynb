We could ask whether there is an analogous thing that happens for phase transitions.  In fact, there is.  The property to look at for phase transitions is to examine how various quantities scale as we approach the phase transition.  In the ferromagnetic transition one thing we could look at is how the magnetization scales as we approach the transition - i.e.\n",

Consider instead the transition between a liquid and a gas.
