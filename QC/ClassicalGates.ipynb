    "\n",
    "Well, first we might want to know if a quantum computer is, at least, as powerful as a classical computer.  Naively, you might think this is completely obvious but there is an important limitation to quantum computers which don't exist for classical computers: quantum computers have to be reversible while classical computers don't.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, suppose we have a classical python function $f(x)$ which can take any number from $0$ to $2^{100}$.    Classically, it would be impossible to run your function on all those numbers.  If you had a set of quantum gates which was implementing $f$ though, you could take $\\sum_i |i\\rangle$ (generated by Hadamards on $|0...0\\rangle$) and then generate  $\\sum_i |f(i)\\rangle$ which is a linear superposition over $2^{100}$ function evaluations.  Unfortunately, this state by itself isn't useful.  If we were to measure now we would just got a random value of $f(x)$ (easy to get classically also by just running $f$ on a random $x$).  But, maybe there are some situations where we can post-process this state which has all $2^{100}$ values of $f$ in it and do something.\n",

    "*Aside:*  This single fact makes quantum mechanics look pretty powerful.  Suppose that I have a function $f$ I want to compute. In the time that classically I can do $f(0)$, in quantum mechanics I can get a superposition $\\sum_i f(i)$. It's as if I did all the calculations in parallel!  *But what happens if I measure the system now?*\n",
