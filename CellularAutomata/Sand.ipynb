Once a column becomes larger then $k$ granules high, 4 granules of sand slide off the pile with one granule ending up on each of the four neighbors.  If the column of sand is on the edge of the table without four neighbors it still ends up with 4 less pieces of sand;  the extra sand just falls off the table.\n",
