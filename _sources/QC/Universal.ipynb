When you just have 1-wire (and therefore 1-qubit) we can visualize that qubit on a bloch sphere  (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere)).  This is sensible because a single qubit has three parameters that specify it (two complex numbers and on constraints).   In our language, $|0\\rangle$ points in the $\\hat{z}$ direction, and $|1\\rangle$ points in the $-\\hat{z}$ direction.  $|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle$ is in the $\\hat{x}$ direction.\n",
