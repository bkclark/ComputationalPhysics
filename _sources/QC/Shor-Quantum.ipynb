    "**Period finding problem:** Given $x$ and $N$, find the $r$ such that $x^r \\textrm{ (mod N) } \\equiv 1 \\textrm{ (mod N) }$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next step is going to be finding that there is a unitary operator $U_{x,N}$ which depends on $x$ and $N$ which has the property that its eigenvalues (essentially) give us $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to describe a unitary operator $U_{x,N}$  which depends on $x$ and $N$.  Remember, one way I can describe what a unitary operator does is to tell you what it does on every basis element.\n",

    "Because the matrix is unitary, the eigenvalues of the matrix are just phases (*convince yourself this has to be true of any unitary matrix*).  We are now going to notice something additionally interesting about these phases.  Take your function which generates this matrix and put it into your classical Shor's algorithm code where you choose $x$ and $N.$\n",

    "Now, run your Shor's algorithm code and find the vector $e$ of all the phase of the eigenvalues (there should be $n$ of them).  If you compute $e*r$, you should notice that you generate integers.  This means that all of the eigenvalues are of the form $s/r$ for some integer $s.$\n",

    "What this means is that if you could find the phase (*we will see soon how to use a quantum computer to do this*) and if you could figure out what the $s$ and $r$ was then you could find the period $r$ you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a general (fast classical) algorithm which takes a decimal number $d$ and finds $s$ and $r$.  This is called the continuing fractions algorithm.\n",

    "Notice, that there are two failure modes in this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You might have a phase of 0.  If you have a phase of 0, there's no way to pull out $r$ since $s=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Suppose you were looking for $s/r=5/10$.  The continuing fraction algorithm will give you $s/r=1/2$ which is true but not very helpful because the period isn't two.  Luckily this doesn't happen because most $s$ and $r$ are co-prime.\n",

    "If you hit one of these failure modes just start over with a new $x$.  These failure modes don't happen too often.\n",
