Those eigenvectors are of size $2N_1N_2 \\times 1$ but there is only a $2 \\times 1$ block that is not zero.  Call $|e_1(\\vec{k})\\rangle$ the $2 \\times 1 $ non-zero block of $|E_1(\\vec{k})\\rangle.$\n",

If you think about what's going on, you are going to add each Berry phase twice once where the arrow is up (right) and once where the arrow is down (left).  This suggests that you're always going to be zero!   What's going on?  We've ignored the fact that we've adjusted each plaquette to be between $-\\pi$ and $\\pi$ by adjusting it by $2\\pi n$.  That means the value might not be zero but must always be some $2\\pi (n_1+n_2+...)$ for some integer $m\\equiv n_1+n_2+...$ (that's all you've done for adjusting).   **The Chern Number is $m$**.
