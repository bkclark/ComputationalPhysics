You needed to make $g$ matrices with $N^2$ numbers in them.  Therefore, the amount of space that you took up was something like $gN^2$ (depending on how you implemented things it might even be just $O(N^2)$ RAM).   In terms of your complexity, you needed to multiply a bunch of $N \\times N $ matrices.  Each such multiplication takes $O(N^3)$ work.  So you needed to do something like $gN^3$ work.\n",
