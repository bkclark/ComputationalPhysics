    "# Non-atomic gates\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build Shor's algorithm, we need a (long-range) control-phase gates.  Our simulator doesn't have these gates as part of their native set.  Instead, we need to figure out how to write the control-phase gates as a combination of our atomic gates - (H,P,CNOT) - which we know can be done because those are a universal gate set.  First let's worry about building a nearest-neighbor phase-gate building it up from a series of simpler gates.  \n",

    "Eventually at the end of this section, we will write a \"compiler\" which take a description in terms of the non-atomic gates and converts them into an atomic-gate description.  \n",
