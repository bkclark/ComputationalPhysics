    "So far you've implemented a number of simulators which take a quantum state as input and output a quantum state.  This is how a quanutm computer works *except* you don't ever actually get to look at the output state in the real world.  Instead, at the end of a computation, you are forced to measure your state.  This measurement gives us a single bit string (integer) from your state;  if you're state is $\\sum_i \\alpha_i |i\\rangle$ you end up seeing state $|i\\rangle$ with probability $|\\alpha_i|^2$.  Notice that this is a stochastic result - every time you run, you end up (potentially) getting a different measurement. \n",
