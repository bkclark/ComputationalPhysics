    "Perhaps the most interesting emergent phenomena in nature are the functions of the brain. You start with what is essentially a bunch of neurons and you end up with a thinking thing. We will try to get a feel for how this is possible by examining simple models of learning based on computational analogues of physical neurons.\n",

    "Computational models of neurons are known as **artificial neural networks**, or sometimes just *neural nets*. While neural nets are grossly simplified models of the brain, they have become useful tools in computer science, engineering, and science to solve a variety of interesting and challenging problems. In this unit, we will look at three artificial neural networks in our investigation of learning.\n",
